# Dirty-Rabbit-Website
Website I made for Dirty Rabbit Wynwood

--I built this project in order to practice CSS and HTML and show myself
I am capable of designing a modern looking website, the javascript included is off of BOOTSTRAP.

--Dirty Rabbit is a club where I am currently employed that has an outdated looking website
so I took it upon myself to challenge myself and redesign it.

--During this project i learned how many things can break while you are building a  website
and troubleshooting every little issue one by one. 

--I gained a stronger understanding of Html formatting CSS and Bootstrap to make the webpage responsive

--Flexbox and Media querys were also included for this purpose.
